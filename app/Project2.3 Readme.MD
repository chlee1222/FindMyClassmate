1. The Emulator device we are using is Pixel 2, API 24. Nougat 24 (Android 7.0) | arm64
2. Username: hi3@gmail.com  Password: hello123.
3. We are using firebase to store our User profile information, and also user login/logout authentication information. In order to display our user information in our profile page, we are fetching from the firebase using their API. 
* Some issues that are possible:
* 1. We were having issues building and running when we were on different versions of misc.xml 
* 2. Authentication with firebase could also be impacted by the same issues as mentioned above for misc.xml.
